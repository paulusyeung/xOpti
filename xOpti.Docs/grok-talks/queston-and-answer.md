## Q1: I regard myself as a full-stack developer. I do frontend and backup for retail industrial applications, for example point-of-sale system for retail chains. 

I am currently asked to upgrade a system that was written on Visula Basic 5 and MS Access MDB for an Optical shop. I need to upgrade it to a web based application with Python + PostgreSQL. I intend to use AI to assist me on doing that. What will you suggest?

## Q2: You've been very helpful, thanks in advance.

I have managed to convert the MDB into PostgreSQL and modified the identities into snake-case with your help. I am now have a PostgreSQL database which contains all the records in the MDB.

I intend to create one REST API and one GraphQL API (both in Python code) for the frontend.

The web frontend, I am considering to use the vue-pure-admin (https://github.com/pure-admin/vue-pure-admin). It allows multi-languages, RBAC, etc.

My main concern is the UI. VB5 allows more informative elements on the same page and reacts fast. I need a quick UI to satisfy the user experience, especially doing point-of-sale functions.

What's your suggestion? I might need a prove-of-concept to convience myself first.

Thanks.
